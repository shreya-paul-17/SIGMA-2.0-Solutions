    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>In HTML, comments are non-rendered text that allows developers to add notes or explanations within the HTML code without affecting the displayed content in the web browser. Comments are essential for documenting the code, providing context, and making it more understandable for other developers who might work on the project in the future.
        Key points about comments in HTML:

Non-Rendered Content: Comments are not displayed in the web browser. They are meant for developers and do not appear in the rendered output of the web page.

Usage and Purpose: Comments are primarily used for documentation and clarification purposes. They help developers explain complex code segments, provide reminders, or describe the purpose of specific sections of the code.

Syntax: HTML comments start with &lt!-- and end with --&gt. Everything between these comment delimiters will be treated as a comment and will not be processed by the browser.

Single and Multi-line Comments: HTML comments can be single-line or multi-line
Nested Comments: Unlike some programming languages, HTML does not support nested comments. You cannot start a new comment within an existing comment.

Conditional Comments (Obsolete): In older versions of Internet Explorer, conditional comments were used to target specific versions of the browser. However, they are now considered obsolete and should not be used.

Best Practices:

Use comments generously to explain complex or tricky code portions.
Comment code sections that might require future changes or updates.
Avoid excessive commenting on self-explanatory code, as it may clutter the codebase unnecessarily.
Remove or update outdated comments to keep the documentation accurate.

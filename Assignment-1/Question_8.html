<p>Front-end Technologies:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Front-end technologies are responsible for the user interface and user experience of a web application. They include:</dt>
            <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The foundation for creating the structure and content of web pages.</dd>
            <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling the appearance and layout of HTML elements.</dd>
            <dd>JavaScript: A versatile scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic content to web pages.</dd>
            <dd>React, Angular, or Vue.js: Popular front-end frameworks for building responsive and interactive user interfaces.</dd>
        
    </dl>
    <p>Back-end Technologies:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Back-end technologies handle server-side operations and business logic of a web application. They include:</dt>
            <dd>Server-side programming languages: Such as Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or C#.</dd>
            <dd>Web Frameworks: Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP), Spring (Java), ASP.NET (C#).</dd>
            <dd>Database Management Systems (DBMS): Like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite, used for storing and managing data.</dd>
            <dd>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): To enable communication between different software components or systems.</dd>
        
    </dl>
    <p>Database and Data Management:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Database and data management technologies are used to store, retrieve, and manage data for the application. They include:</dt>
            <dd>Relational Databases: Used for structured data, typically using SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the database.</dd>
            <dd>NoSQL Databases: Suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, like JSON, XML, or key-value pairs.</dd>
            <dd>ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries: To facilitate interaction between the application and the database using objects.</dd>
            
        
    </dl>
    <p>Web Servers and Hosting:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Web servers and hosting technologies are responsible for deploying and serving the web application to users. They include:</dt>
            <dd>Web Servers: Such as Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.</dd>
            <dd>Cloud Platforms: Like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, used for deploying and hosting web applications in the cloud.</dd>
            <dd>Containerization: Technologies like Docker to package the application and its dependencies for easy deployment.</dd>

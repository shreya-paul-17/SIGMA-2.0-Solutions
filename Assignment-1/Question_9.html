    <ol>
        <li>&ltem&gt (Emphasis):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Case: The &ltem&gt tag is used to indicate text that should be emphasized or emphasized in some way. It typically renders as italicized </li>
           
            <li>Best Practices: Use &ltem&gt to emphasize keywords, phrases, or important points within a paragraph. Avoid using it solely for styling purposes; reserve it for semantically meaningful content.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
       <li>&ltstrong&gt (Strong Importance):</li>
       <ul>
            <li>Use Case: The &ltstrong&gt tag is used to indicate strong importance, often rendering as bold text. It carries more weight than &ltem&gt and is used to highlight more critical information.</li>
            <li>Best Practices: Use &ltstrong&gt to emphasize content that is crucial for understanding the context or message of the text. Avoid using it for decorative purposes or to make text bold merely for visual appeal.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <li>&ltu&gt (Underline):</li>
        <ul>

            <li>Use Case: The &ltu&gt tag is used to underline text, indicating a span of text that needs special attention or relevance.</li>
            <li>Best Practices: Use underlining sparingly and only when necessary, as underlined text is commonly associated with hyperlinks. It's generally better to use &ltem&gt or &ltstrong&gt for emphasis and avoid underlining for non-link text.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <li>&lts&gt (Strikethrough):</li>
        <ul> 
            <li>Use Case: The &lts&gt tag is used to apply a line through the text, indicating that the content is no longer accurate or valid (e.g., for indicating a removed item).</li>
            <li>Best Practices: Use &lts&gt to represent deleted or outdated information, such as price reductions or outdated details. Avoid using it for decorative purposes or to make text look visually appealing.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <li>&ltsup&gt (Superscript) and &ltsub&gt (Subscript):</li>

         <ul>  <li>Use Case: The &ltsup&gt tag is used to display superscript text (raised above the baseline), while 
            &ltsub&gt is used to display subscript text (lowered below the baseline).</li>
        <li>Best Practices: Use &ltsup&gt for footnotes, exponentiation, and other instances where text should appear raised. Use &ltsub&gt for chemical formulas, mathematical notation, or any content that should appear lowered.</li>
        </ul>
    
       <li>&ltcode&gt (Inline Code):</li>

         <ul><li>Use Case: The &ltcode&gt tag is used to indicate inline code or code snippets within the text. It typically renders in a monospaced font.</li>
        <li>Best Practices: Use &ltcode&gt to represent code snippets or command examples. Ensure that the code is properly formatted and distinguishable from regular text for better readability.</li></ul>
    
        <li>&ltpre&gt (Preformatted Text):</li>
        <ul> <li>Use Case: The &ltpre&gt tag is used to display preformatted text, preserving spaces, line breaks, and indentation exactly as written in the HTML source code.</li>
        <li>Best Practices: Use &ltpre&gt for displaying code blocks, ASCII art, or any content that requires strict preservation of whitespace and line breaks.</li></ul>
    
        <li>&ltblockquote&gt (Block Quote):
        </li>
        <ul> <li> Use Case: The &ltblockquote&gt tag is used to indicate a block of quoted text, typically indented and visually distinguished from the rest of the content.</li>
        <li>Best Practices: Use &ltblockquote&gt to attribute quoted content to its original source. Style it with CSS to provide visual differentiation from regular paragraphs.</li></ul>
    </ol>
